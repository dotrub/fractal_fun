Messing around with calculating and displaying fractals on the HTML canvas

## Notes
Optimal viewing size for now is 1230x984, I'll work later on making this more responsive.

Currently keeping the iterations stuck at 1000, which seems to be a good compromise between speed and detail. However, since the math is done in the browser with Javascript, the resolution is limited due to precision errors.
