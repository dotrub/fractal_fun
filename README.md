Messing around with calculating and displaying fractals on the HTML canvas

## Notes
Optimal viewing size for now is 1230x984, I'll work later on making this more responsive.

Currently keeping the iterations stuck at 100, I may add the ability to scale it later but the program slows down quite a bit after 1000 or so. The result is that you can't zoom very far before losing resolution.
